# Define known values
food_cost = 79.25
tax = 6.54
tip = 12.00

# Calculate the unknown
total_due = food_cost + tax + tip

# Display the results
print("The total due is " + str(total_due))

print("Food cost is " + str(food_cost) + " and tax is " + str(tax))  # Corrected quotes and spacing
#print(Tip is Â + str(tip))  
print("Tip is " + format(tip, ".2f"))
print("Total due is " + str(total_due))  # Corrected quotes

#Bonus quesiton " " won't work within the string, had to remove to get code to run.
