customer_id = "CUS123456"       
## String to handle alphanumeric IDs

## String for middle name

## 4

my_name = "Symone Gant"            
## String for name
birth_city = "Chicago"  
## String for city name
birth_state = "Illinois"    
## String for state name
            
## 3 Assumptions

## customer_id: Used string type to accommodate possible alphanumeric combinations
## Name fields: Used strings since names contain letters and sometimes special characters
## gender: Used string for flexibility (could be extended to handle non-binary options)
## date_of_birth: Used string in ISO format (could alternatively use Python's datetime)
## license_number: Used string since license numbers often contain both letters and numbers
## policy_number: Used string to handle potential special characters or leading zeros

## Lab 2 question 1

## What is the full list of reserved words that can’t be used for variable names?
 
## False	def	if	raise None	del	import	return True	elif	in	try and	else is	while as except	lambda	with
## assert	finally	nonlocal	yield break	for	not class	form	or continue	global	pass

## Question 2

## The raise statement is used to raise an error. These errors are visible in the traceback and they cancel the execution of the program if not handled properly.

## The del statement is used to delete an object in Python.

## The in statement is used to check if an element is present in an iterable like list or tuple.

## The try statement is used to make a try… except statement. The try statement starts a block of code that is tried to execute. If it fails, the except block catches the error.

## The as statement in Python re-assigns a returned object to a new identifier. Basically, it creates an alias
